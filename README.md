# eve-marketLTSM
Using eve-market API data for a LTSM neural network to predict prices. 


Following the guide here from Dr.Brownlee.http://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/

Just learning how neural networks can be used for time-series problems, as well as introducing myself to Keras and Theano. 
Plan on streamlining how EVE-market api is handled, i.e instead of manually deleting rows, will try and find an alternative to eve-market.
